            <h1><b>ARTS</b></h1>
            <p>Art has a language of it's own, it is something that can express 
                happiness,sadness and all sorts of emotions.
                Art is in many forms, but few of the arts that I know are quilling and sospeso.
                These are the arts that I learnt when I was in my 7th standard and I love to engage 
                myself with these arts.
